How do I perform a case insensitive search?
Replace -name option with -iname as follows:

find  / -type d -iname "apt" -ls
OR

find  / -type d -iname "apt"
The patterns ‘apt’ match the directory names ‘apt’, ‘APT’, ‘Apt’, ‘apT’, etc.

Type any one of the following command:

find  / -type d -iname "project.images" -ls
OR

find  / -type d -name "project.images" -ls

find  / -type d -name "project.images"
It is also possible to use the wild cards as follows:

find  / -type d -name "project.*"
find  /dir/to/search/ -type d -name "project.image??"
A note about locate command
To search for a file/dir named exactly project.images (not *project.images*), type:

locate -b '\project.images'
